Going to the gym can be a daunting experience for many people. This can stem from several different factors, including (but not limited to) being new to working out and being self-conscious about their appearance. This can also be experienced by those who are uncomfortable with people watching them at the gym. Whatever it may be, this feeling is holding many from working out and reaching their fitness goals.

This feeling of unease is commonly referred to as gymtimidation. This can eventually lead to an overall negative attitude toward exercise.

In this article, we’ll go over what gymtimidation is, and how to beat it once and for all to finally reach your fitness and gym goals!

As mentioned before, gymtimidation is a feeling of self-consciousness and anxiety that occurs when people work out. However, this intimidation is not always exclusive to the gym. In a study conducted by [Isopure](http://www.theisopurecompany.com/), they found that many people even feel intimidated while going for a run outside.

This feeling is a common one, with half of all Americans experiencing this. Specifically, 32% of these Americans explain that they experience this while working out near someone extremely fit. Additionally, 17% experience this while working out near someone of the opposite sex.

This feeling is generally faced because of a lack of confidence in their workouts and themselves. This is intensified when people enter a gym with others who seemingly have better physiques and routines.

There are several ways to overcome gymtimidation and start feeling confident in the gym. One effective strategy is to start with the basics. Begin by focusing on simple exercises that you are comfortable with and gradually work your way up to more complex movements. By doing so, you can gain more confidence in your workouts before moving on to something you aren’t sure of.

It's also helpful to find a workout buddy who can provide support and encouragement. Having someone to share the experience with can make it feel less intimidating. They can also watch your form and movements to ensure what you’re doing is not only correct but also safe to prevent injury.

Another way to beat gymtimidation is to plan ahead. Before heading to the gym, create a workout plan that includes specific exercises and equipment that you want to use. Having a plan in place can help you feel more prepared and less anxious about what to do next.

Since most gymtimidation stems from the fact that gyms have crowds, one way to beat it is to simply find ways to work out alone. Whether this means going to the gym early in the day or working out at home, this can eliminate any sort of anxiety or intimidation you could feel.

If you’re looking for spaces to work out alone, you could also try switching to private gyms. Private gyms are home gyms in your area that you’re able to rent out for a fraction of the cost of your own home gym. From yoga studios to weight rooms, home gyms can give you a personal gym experience that can help you beat gymtimidation and still get a full workout in. Look for private gyms on [Gym2Gym.com](http://gym2gym.com/) today, and work out in peace!

Finally, it's essential to remember that everyone at the gym is there to improve their health and fitness. Nobody is judging you, and everyone is at a different stage in their fitness journey. Focus on your own progress and set achievable goals for yourself. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem.

Gymtimidation is a common experience for many people, but it doesn't have to hold you back from achieving your fitness goals. By starting with the basics, planning ahead, and remembering that everyone is there to improve, you can overcome gymtimidation and feel confident in the gym. With time and practice, going to the gym can become a positive and empowering experience.
